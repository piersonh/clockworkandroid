## Goal/Motivation
Students (or people in general) are bad at estimating how long it will take them to complete tasks.  ClockWork is a tool to help them improve that ability.

## Design/Development
ClockWork is an Android app written in Kotlin using Jetpack Compose, Android Room, ehsannarmani/Compose Charts, and Apache Commons Math.

**Patterns/Principles Used:**
- MVVM
- Clean
- UDF
- Repository
- App Container (Manual Dependency Injection)
- Dependency Inversion
- Use Cases
- Single Responsibility
- ADT (for making invalid states unrepresentable)
